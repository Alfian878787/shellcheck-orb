        description: |
          This file pattern (as passed to `find -not -path`) is used to select
          a path to exclude when searching for files. Currently, this is
          limited to a single pattern.
      path:
        type: string
        default: .
        description: The top-most directory to search for files in.
      pattern:
        type: string
        default: "*.sh"

          The file pattern as passed to `find` to locate shell scripts.

        type: string
        default: /dev/tty
        description: |
          The destination of the test reports. By default they are sent only
          to the tty stdout, but the path to a file can be set here to allow
          them to be saved as job artifacts.
      executor:
        type: executor
        default: shellcheck
        description: |
          Override executor with a custom executor, for example, to choose a
          different version tag.
